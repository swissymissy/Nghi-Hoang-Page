Hello, my name is Nghi Hoang, and I'm a senior Computer Science student at University of South Florida. I enjoy building software projects that combine creativity and problem solving.
Recently, I've been exploring **APIs** and how they connect applications together, and I'm planning to expand my skills into cloud computing, especially platforms like **AWS**. I'm always excited to learn new technologies and apply them to real-world problems.

## Projects

- [Why Glorfindel is More Impressive than Legolas](/blog/glorfindel)
- [Why Tom Bombadil Was a Mistake](/blog/tom)
- [The Unparalleled Majesty of "The Lord of the Rings"](/blog/majesty)

## Reasons I like Tolkien

- You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
- It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
- Disney _didn't ruin it_ (okay, but Amazon might have)
- It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

## My favorite characters (in order)

1. Gandalf
2. Bilbo
3. Sam
4. Glorfindel
5. Galadriel
6. Elrond
7. Thorin
8. Sauron
9. Aragorn

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```
