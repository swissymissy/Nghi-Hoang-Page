Hello, my name is Nghi Hoang, and I'm a senior Computer Science student at University of South Florida. I enjoy building software projects that combine creativity and problem solving.
Recently, I've been exploring **APIs** and how they connect applications together, and I'm planning to expand my skills into cloud computing, especially platforms like **AWS**. I'm always excited to learn new technologies and apply them to real-world problems.
